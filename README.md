# videopoker

<p>This is a JavaScript program I am working on that will play video poker. </p>
<p>It will hopefully be a thing to show odds and good / bad moves to perhaps train someone to learn better video poker strategies</p>

## TODO:

- Betting
- Evaluate the hand (what do I have currently)
- Show odds of best hands possible
- Show if player made good / bad move
- much more!
